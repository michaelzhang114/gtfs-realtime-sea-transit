## Description

## Usage

## Todo
1. UI input: Bus route name and direction (visual), and pick the stop -> backend: route_id, direction_id, stop_id

To make the time est logic better:
- need to get direction_id from route_id + stop_id
- from trip_id, get list of stop_id





1. Get all trips from static gtfs trips.txt
2. Given a trip ID, get the shape ID (static trips.txt)
3. From the shape ID, get the coordinates of all the stops
